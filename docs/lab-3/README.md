# Using the InstructLab UI

Now that you've run InstructLab locally, let's try contributing to the Open-Source project using the [InstructLab UI](https://qa.ui.instructlab.ai/)

## Verify Access

If you are not part of the InstructLab organization already, you will need to request access using your github username
through this [link](https://instructlab-inviter-instructlab-public-inviter.qa-ui-instructlab-ai-0e3e0ef4c9c6d831e8aa6fe01f33bfc4-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/)

You will then be able to login the [InstructLab UI](https://qa.ui.instructlab.ai/) using GitHub SSO

## Chatting with Model

Through the UI, you will have access to the chat function. Like the chat through the CLI, this will allow you to chat with the model
to see if the model has the knowledge/skill you are looking for. Unlike the CLI version, this will give you the opportunity to chat
with a full Granite-7B model, giving you a better understanding of what capabilities the model already has.

You can navigate to this Chat by going the the menu on the left-hand side -> Playground dropdown -> Chat
