## Development Environment

### Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

You may use any IDE, but this workshop assumes you're using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

    2. Search for “Python” by Microsoft and install it
    3. Search for "Jupyter" by Microsoft and install it

## Python Environment Manager

### `uv` (Recommended)

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as your Python package and environment manager.

- If you’re unfamiliar with `uv`, refer to the [uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
- `uv` is a fast and modern alternative to pip and virtualenv, fully compatible with both

## API Keys

### Tavily (Required)

- Go to [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/home) and sign up for a free API key.

### OpenAI (Optional)

- Only needed if you do **not** plan to run a model locally with Ollama.
- [Get an OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Local Model (Optional if using OpenAI)

### Install Ollama

!!! note
    To run the Granite model locally, we recommend having at least **16GB of RAM** for optimal performance.

To run models locally on your machine:

1. Download and install Ollama: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Run or pull the Granite model:

   ```bash
   ollama run granite3.3:8b
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ollama pull granite3.3:8b
   ```

> Model link: [Granite 3.3:8b](https://ollama.com/library/granite3.3:8b)

## Redis as a vector database

We'll be using Redis for local vector storage.

### Install Redis

- Follow the [official installation instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/)
