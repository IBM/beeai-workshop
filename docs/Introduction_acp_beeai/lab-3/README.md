# Interact with your Agents in the BeeAI Platform

In this lab, we'll run our TicketWorkflow that we created in Lab 2 in the BeeAI platform. The BeeAI platform creates a simple and elegant UI so that we can test, run, and share our agents easily.

## Steps

### 1. Open the Project Directory

If you don't already have the `intro_acp_beeai` folder open in VS Code, navigate there. Your working directory should look something like this: `~/beeai-workshop/intro_acp_beeai`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

If you already did this in Lab 1 or 2, you can skip this step. If not, open your terminal (either in VS Code or using your preferred terminal) and install the dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

### 3. Run the Ticket Workflow Agent

In your terminal, run the ticket workflow agent (defaults to run on port 8000):

```shell
uv run src/ticket_workflow_agent.py
```

!!! insight
    If you take a look at the code you will notice that there are 3 ACP agents in this `ticket_workflow_agent.py` file. The main agent, named "TicketWorkflow", orchestrates the run of the `ticket_triage_agent` and `ticket_response_agent` sequentially. Pay special attention to the metadata in the `@server.agent` decorator. The UI type informs the platform how the end user should interact with the agent. If the agent doesn't have UI metadata defined, it will not be visible in the platform.

### 4. Launch the BeeAI UI

You should have already installed, started, and set up your LLM provider in the BeeAI Platform by following the Workshop Specific Requirements section of the Pre-Work. If you have not, please go back and follow them before proceeding.

In your terminal, run:

```shell
beeai ui
```

You should see the UI launch in your browser.

!!! insight
    If you navigate to the menu bar on the left hand side you will see a list of agents. All 3 agents that we are running on the active server appear because they each have UI metadata in their agent detail. If we killed the server, these agents would instantly disappear.

### 5. Run the TicketWorkflow in the BeeAI Platform

1. Navigate to the menu bar on the left hand side and select the TicketWorkflow
2. Enter in the sample text or have fun with coming up with your own ticket:

    ```text
    Hi there, this is Jane Doe. Ever since yesterday your ProPlan won't let me export reports. This is blocking my quarter-end closeâ€”please fix ASAP or refund the month.AccountNumber: 872-55
    ```

3. Press run

**Expected Results:**

You should see both the triage output (structured data about the ticket) and the response output (a human-like customer service response) in the platform interface.

### 6. Clean Up

1. Stop the ACP agent servers using `Ctrl + C` or exiting the terminal where it is running.
2. Stop the platform by running this command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    beeai platform stop
    ```

## Congratulations! You've completed the Introduction to ACP + BeeAI Workshop.
