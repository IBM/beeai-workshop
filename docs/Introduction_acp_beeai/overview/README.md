# Welcome to the BEEAI + ACP Workshop!

You'll be diving into how to use Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) to enable seamless agent-to-agent communication and easily compose user interfaces to run and share your agents.

During this workshop, you'll explore a ticket triage scenario featuring two specialized agents: a **triage agent** that categorizes customer tickets into structured outputs (classifying ticket types and extracting key details) and a **response agent** that crafts replies based on ticket classification with appropriate tone and messaging. All three parts of this lab build upon this scenario.

## Workshop Structure

This lab consists of 3 progressive parts:

### Part 1: Running Individual ACP Agents
* Execute an ACP agent built with the BeeAI framework and ACP SDK
* Execute an ACP-compatible agent built with the Pydantic AI framework and ACP SDK  
* Invoke both agents using curl commands or the OpenAPI UI

### Part 2: Platform Integration
* Launch the BeeAI Platform and observe automatic agent registration
* Run your agents through the BeeAI GUI

### Part 3: Workflow Orchestration
* Create a new workflow agent that sequentially orchestrates the two existing agents
* Execute the workflow in both CLI and BeeAI platform environments
