# Welcome to the Introduction to ACP and BeeAI Workshop!

You'll be diving into how to use Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) to enable seamless agent-to-agent communication and easily compose user interfaces to run and share your agents.

During this workshop, you'll explore a ticket triage scenario featuring two specialized agents: a **triage agent** that categorizes customer tickets into structured outputs (classifying ticket types and extracting key details) and a **response agent** that crafts replies based on ticket classification with appropriate tone and messaging. All three parts of this lab build upon this scenario.

## Workshop Structure

This lab consists of 3 progressive parts:

### Lab 1: Running Individual ACP Agents

* Invoke an ACP agent built with the BeeAI framework and ACP SDK
* Execute an ACP-compatible agent built with the Pydantic AI framework and ACP SDK  
* Invoke agents using curl commands or the OpenAPI UI

### Lab 2: Run a ACP Multi-Agent Workflow

* Create a new workflow agent that sequentially orchestrates two pre-built agents of different frameworks
* Execute the ACP agent in the through the OpenAPI UI and/or CLI

### Lab 3: Workflow Orchestration

* Bring your workflow agent into the BeeAI Platform
* Execute the workflow in the BeeAI platform environment
