# Building Production-Ready AI Agents in the Open Source Ecosystem

This hands-on workshop guides participants through building intelligent AI agents using IBM's open source stack with a focus on local deployment and production readiness. Attendees will create a complete pipeline starting with Docling for document preprocessing, then deploy Granite models locally via Ollama for private, cost-effective inference, and finally orchestrate everything through Bee Agent Framework. The workshop emphasizes practical integration and local deployment strategies, perfect for organizations requiring data privacy or cost control.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### Document Preprocessing Pipeline

Use Docling to extract and structure content from complex documents (PDFs, presentations, forms), creating clean, standardized data ready for AI agent consumption.

### Local Granite Deployment with Ollama

Download and configure Granite models locally using Ollama.

### Granite in Practice

Practice summarizing a text document, entity extraction, and multi-modal RAG using Docling and Granite models.

### Production Ready Agent Development with Tools

Build multi-step agents workflows using the BeeAI Framework. Implement custom tools (including MCP tools), memory optimization strategies, built-in observability, resource management, and more.

### Using the Agent Stack as an A2A agent server and multi-agent UI

- **Serving agents** – Run an agent from source and see it automatically register with Agent Stack
- **UI forms** – Create a form to use for an agent UI
- **Monitoring** – Monitor and debug agents with built-in logging and tracing capabilities

## 📚 What You'll Learn

Through interactive coding exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

### Core Components

- **System Prompts** – Learn the foundation of agent behavior by crafting effective prompts that guide your agent's responses
- **RequirementAgent** – Explore BeeAI's powerful agent implementation that provides fine-grained control over agent behavior
- **LLM Providers** – Work with both local and hosted model options to understand deployment flexibility

### Advanced Features

- **Memory Systems** – Implement conversation context to maintain coherent, contextual interactions across sessions
- **Tools Integration** – Extend agent capabilities by integrating external APIs and data sources
- **Conditional Requirements** – Enforce business logic and rules to ensure compliance and consistency
- **Monitoring** – Monitor and debug agents with built-in logging and tracing capabilities
