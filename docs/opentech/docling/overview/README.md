# Introduction

In this workshop we'll be walking through the features of [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/)

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to use Docling to:

* Convert complex documents into various formats suitable for AI
* Understand the various methods of [Chunking](https://www.ibm.com/architectures/papers/rag-cookbook/chunking) and how to use them
* Create a transparent and verifiable multimodal [RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) application
