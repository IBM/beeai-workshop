# Introduction to Agent Stack

In this demo. You'll master the fundamental components of **Agent Stack** by building and running a Conference Prep Agent that helps field marketing teams prepare for conference season.

Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn how to create intelligent agents with real-world applications.

## 🎯 Scenario

The Field Marketing Lead has asked you to help prepare their team for conference season. You'll create a **Conference Prep Agent** that intelligently combines multiple information sources to provide comprehensive conference preparation materials.

Your agent will integrate three powerful tools:

1. **Web Search** – Collect relevant news and up-to-date information about attendees, speakers, and industry trends
2. **Wikipedia Tool** – Provide company history and background details on organizations and key people
3. **Internal Knowledge Base** – Access the team's internal notes and artifacts for context-specific information

### Agent Stack

- **Serving agents** – Run an agent from source and see it automatically register with Agent Stack
- **UI forms** – Use a form as input to the agent with the Agent Stack UI
- **Monitoring** – Monitor and debug agents with built-in logging and tracing capabilities

### Agent Core Components
