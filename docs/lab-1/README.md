# Generating Bash Code with Granite Code

[Generative AI](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI) refers to deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on. A [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) is a type of language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language understanding and generation.

The goal of this lab is to show how you can use [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) with the [IBM Granite Code](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/code/) LLMs in order to generate [Bash](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash) programming language or code.

## Prerequisites

This lab is a [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Please follow the instructions in [pre-work](../pre-work/README.md) to run the lab.
