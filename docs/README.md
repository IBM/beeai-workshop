## The BeeAI Ecosystem

BeeAI is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing multi-agent AI systems. Whether you're a developer creating sophisticated agent workflows or a business user leveraging shared agents, BeeAI provides the tools and infrastructure to make AI agents more accessible, interoperable, and production-ready.

BeeAI consists of two integrated components that work together to streamline the entire agent life cycle:

### 1. **Build** with the BeeAI Framework

Build multi-agent systems leveraging agents from any framework that meet your requirements.

#### For Developers

- Build multi-agent systems that meet custom requirements while leveraging production-grade, out-of-the-box components
- Run and test custom agents in a consistent development environment
- Leverage templates and examples to accelerate development

### 2. **Configure, Deploy, Run, Share, and Govern** in the BeeAI Platform

Make your agents easy to share and run with others no matter what agent framework they were built on!

#### For Developers

- Configure agents to leverage ready-made UIs provided by the platform
- Specify recommended models for optimal agent performance
- Easily observe agent performance with real end users
- Maintain visibility into agent usage and behavior through comprehensive telemetry, access controls, and audit trails
- Locally run your agents with a UI or self host the platform to enable a hosted experience for your users

#### For Business Users

- Experience consistent UI across different agents shared with you
- Use agents successfully without understanding their internal workings
