# Welcome to BeeAI

## Workshops

Explore BeeAI through hands-on workshops that demonstrate how BeeAI's integrated components work together to create powerful, collaborative agent systems.

## The BeeAI Ecosystem

BeeAI is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing multi-agent AI systems. Whether you're a developer creating sophisticated agent workflows or a business user leveraging shared agents, BeeAI provides the tools and infrastructure to make AI agents more accessible, interoperable, and production-ready.

BeeAI consists of three integrated components that work together to streamline the entire agent lifecycle:

### 1. **Build** with the BeeAI Framework

Build multi-agent systems leveraging agents from any framework that meet your requirements.

#### For Developers:

* Build multi-agent systems that meet custom requirements while leveraging production-grade, out-of-the-box components
* Run and test custom agents in a consistent development environment
* Leverage templates and examples to accelerate development

### 2. **Collaborate** with Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)

Enable seamless interoperability between agents built in different frameworks through standardized communication.

ACP is an HTTP REST-based protocol built on client-server architecture that standardizes how agents communicate (their inputs and outputs). This enables agents built in any framework to collaborate with one another, forming the foundation for agent collaboration in the BeeAI Platform.

### 3. **Configure, Deploy, Run, Share, and Govern** in the BeeAI Platform

Make the deployment process frictionless from development to production with comprehensive governance capabilities.

#### For Developers:

* Configure agents to leverage ready-made UIs provided by the platform
* Specify recommended models for optimal agent performance
* Easily set up environment and authentication configuration for end users
* Seamless pathway from local development to shareable deployments
* Share agents with specific people rather than entire organizations
* Easily observe agent performance with real end users
* Monitor user feedback to continuously improve agents
* Maintain visibility into agent usage and behavior through comprehensive telemetry, access controls, and audit trails

#### For Business Users:

* Experience consistent UI across different agents shared with you
* Use agents successfully without understanding their internal workings
