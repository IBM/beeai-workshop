# Welcome to BeeAI

## Workshops

Explore BeeAI through hands-on workshops that demonstrate how BeeAI's integrated components work together to create powerful, collaborative agent systems.

## The BeeAI Ecosystem

BeeAI Framework and Agent Stack platform are a series of Linux Foundation projects advancing AI agents. In the BeeAI Framework you can build reliable, intelligent agents with our lightweight framework that goes beyond prompting and enforces rules. The Agent Stack Platform allows you to deploy and share agents with open infrastructure, free from framework or vendor lock-in. Both projects are complimentary, but not dependent.

### **Build** with the BeeAI Framework

Build multi-agent systems leveraging agents from any framework that meet your requirements.

#### For Developers

- Build multi-agent systems that meet custom requirements while leveraging production-grade, out-of-the-box components
- Preserve your agent's reasoning abilities while enforcing deterministic rules instead of suggesting behavior.
- Integrate with your existing stack in minutes with native OpenTelemetry support for auditing and monitoring.
- Build MCP-compatible components, equip agents with MCP tools, and interoperate with any MCP or A2A agent.


### 2. **Configure, Deploy, Run, Share, and Govern** in the Agent Stack Platform

Make your agents easy to share and run with others no matter what agent framework they were built on!

#### For Developers

- Run agents from LangChain, CrewAI, BeeAI and more on a single platform. Enable cross-framework collaboration without rewriting your code.
- Generate a shareable front-end from your code in minutes. Focus on your agent's logic, not UI frameworks.
- Go from container to production-ready. We handle database, storage, scaling, and RAG so you can focus on your agent.
- Test across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, IBM watsonx, Ollama and more. Instantly compare performance and cost to find the optimal model.
- Locally run your agents with a UI or self host the platform to enable a hosted experience for your users

#### For Business Users

- Experience consistent UI across different agents shared with you
- Use agents successfully without understanding their internal workings
